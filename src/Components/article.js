        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCar} /> Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. With urbanization on the rise and vehicles becoming an integral part of modern life, emissions from automobiles remain a significant contributor to air quality degradation. Harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been linked to severe health issues and environmental damage.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For years, scientists and engineers have worked tirelessly to develop technologies that reduce these harmful emissions. One of the most successful solutions to date has been the catalytic converter—an essential component in modern cars that reduces toxic exhaust emissions. However, while catalytic converters have greatly improved air quality, the technology has not advanced at the same pace as the growing pollution crisis. As a result, there is an urgent need to upgrade and enhance these systems to meet more stringent environmental standards.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowRight} /> This is where research and innovation step in. By exploring novel materials and catalytic systems, it is possible to improve the efficiency of pollutant conversion and minimize the environmental impact of vehicle emissions. One promising avenue of research involves the use of advanced materials like copper, which exhibit excellent catalytic properties for the conversion of harmful gases like carbon monoxide into harmless byproducts such as CO2.
